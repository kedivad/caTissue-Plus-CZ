Frozen biological samples from Dana Farber Cancer Institute are transported between the Longwood Medical Area and the Harbor campus. These materials are not known to be infectious; however, it is DFCI standard practice to require that all clinical samples and non-exempt research materials to be transported are packaged to meet the Department of Transportation (DOT) Criteria for Biological Substance, Category B.  

This requires: secure primary container, absorbent material, leak proof secondary container, a sturdy outer container, and DOT labeling as Biological Substance, Category B, UN3373.  The label is not required for exempt specimens.
